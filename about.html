      <p class="para">
        Can you imagine your life without music? It’s almost impossible. Whether
        we are cruising in the car headed to the beach on a hot summer day or
        listening to muzak at a doctor’s office, we are constantly surrounded by
        song. Makeups, breakups, parties, hanging out with friends, singing
        along with our kids, or caroling a Christmas tune—music stamps nearly
        every aspect of our life. Much in the way a killer soundtrack
        accompanies a movie, most of us have songs that accent each phase of our
        lives, melodies that instantly bring us back to specific moments or
        memories when we hear them even years later.

        bringing peace, abolishing strife.” — Kahlil Gibran
